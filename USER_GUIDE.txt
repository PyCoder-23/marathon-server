  - Title and description
  - XP reward (with star icon)
  - Difficulty badge (color-coded)
  - Mission type icon
  - Current status (Available/In Progress/Completed)
  - Action button (Accept/Check Progress/Completed)

   - Study for X minutes
   - Complete Y sessions
   - Maintain Z day streak
   - Study during specific times/days
4. Click "Check Progress" to verify completion

MISSION PENALTIES (NEW FEATURE):

  - You lose HALF the XP reward (rounded up)
  - Example: 150 XP mission incomplete = -75 XP penalty
  - Example: 100 XP mission incomplete = -50 XP penalty
• Penalties are deducted from your total XP
• Your XP can go negative
• Penalty affects your squad's ranking (calculated from members)
• XP transaction is created with source="mission"
• Penalty message appears in console logs

MISSION STRATEGY:
• Accept missions you're confident you can complete
